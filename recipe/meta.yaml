  summary: Pure Python 3-D geographic coordinate conversions and geodesy

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    Pure Python (no prerequistes beyond Python itself) 3-D geographic
    coordinate conversions and geodesy.
    API similar to popular $1000 Matlab Mapping Toolbox.
    PyMap3D is intended for non-interactive use on massively parallel (HPC)
    and embedded systems.
    Includes some relevant Vallado algorithms.
    PyMap3D  provides conversion routines for the following coordinate systems:
    * geodetic
    * geocentric
    * AER: Azimuth, Elevation, Range
    * ECEF: Earth-centered, Earth-fixed
    * ECI: Earth-centered Inertial
    * ENU: East North Up
    * NED: North East Down
    * radec: right ascension, declination
